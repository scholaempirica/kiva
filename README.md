This is the README file for your project. Edit it as you like.

It shows up when someone looks at the Github repository.

It should inform others what the project is about and give basic
information about what is in the repository and how to use it.


If you would like to run R code in your README, run `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`



This project was created using the `reschola` project template
and should follow the `reschola` workflow.

See <scholaemprica.github.io/reschola> for details.



Note that the `data-raw` and `data-processed` directories are intentionally configured
to disallow adding files to git, and hence empty on Github.
The raw data is to be inserted manually or downloaded from Google Drive
and the processed data is created by the scripts in the project.

See the project documentation to see exactly how to recreate the data files.
Only change the .gitignore files in those directories if you are sure it is a good idea.
